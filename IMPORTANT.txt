Important notes:
  -> Center of mass (COM) is calculated in real coordinates. For PBC this could be wrong
     depending on what you want (fold coordinates back into unit cell)
  -> In order to keep everything as parallel as possible, most measurement variables are actually
     arrays with size TARGETNUMTHREADS, which are then summed up in a single region in main
